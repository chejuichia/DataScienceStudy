# Technical Portfolio
Juichia's Data Science & Machine Learning Projects at a Glance

## Winner of Data Science Hackathon
### [Porsche Electric Vehicle Hackathon 2020](https://github.com/juichiaholland/DataScienceHackathon/blob/master/assessing_environmental_impact/reports/PorscheEVStrategy.pdf)
What are the locations with demand for more EV charging infrastructure? What types of charging infrastructure are lacking or are popular in the locations of demand? What are the locations with demand for EV at the Porsche Taycan price level? Who are the consumers that live around these locations of demand? What are the preferred EV attributes for these consumers in these locations?

Workinig in a team of 3, our proposal to answer these questions was selected out of 19+ teams to compete in the final hackathon, and our final analysis and presentation won second place in the competition. All deliverables were completed within 10 days.

## Capstone Project 1
### [Improving Success Rates of Restaurants](https://github.com/juichiaholland/DataScienceStudy/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%201/Capstone%20Project%201%20Presentation.pdf)
Restaurants are a big part of modern life and they make up a significant portion of small businesses everywhere. They are known for high turnover and failure rates, especially within the first year of business. Failed restaurants are costly to the restaurateurs, to the industry and to the diners. When restaurants fail as businesses, the restaurateurs themselves and their financial sponsors bear economic burden, the food services industry lose potential growth from the contribution of new ideas and economy, and the diners lose out on opportunities for new enjoyable experiences. This study in data science aims to help restaurateurs to incorporate more success factors into their strategies when opening new restaurants.

## Capstone Project 2
### [Improving Demand Forecasting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uSFY0B0ZUD9SckeqUS_kKmI5MuusDnZI0YiTL27q3LQ/edit?usp=sharing)
What is the seasonality of products in a store? How does demand compare across different stores for the same item? What about seasonally? What will the demand for a product be in the next few months? Accurate forecasting of sales and demand is an important part to managing the supply chain for both online and physical retail. This study in data science analyzes the sales of 50 different items at 10 stores across 5 years and goes through a process of fine tuning the forecasts in demand.
